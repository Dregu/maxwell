MAXWELL is an ingame ImGui overlay for the game ANIMAL WELL, featuring an inventory editor, warping map, cheats etc.

**Please go away if you haven't finished the game, this will spoil everything for you.**

## Disclaimer

I shouldn't have to tell you, but you should back up your save file before using a random experimental tool you found on the internet, but there you go.
This can cause irreversible damage to your save file, but probably won't if you don't do it on purpose.
If you care about your Steam achievements, you should probably use some kind of [Steam Emulator](https://mr_goldberg.gitlab.io/goldberg_emulator/) before poking around with this, as it doesn't block achievements yet.
Your antivirus will probably not like this tool because of the dll injection aspect, but you can handle that like you want to.
This is not a virus, but you probably shouldn't believe a random file on the internet telling you that either...

## Usage

Build with cmake or get the [Autobuild](https://github.com/Dregu/maxwell/releases/tag/autobuild). Put MAXWELL folder in the game directory and run from there. Or anywhere, the injector should attach to a running game process automatically too.
