I shouldn't have to tell you, but you should back up your save file before using a random experimental tool you found on the internet, but there you go.
Your antivirus will probably not like this tool because of the dll injection aspect, but you can deal with that like you want to.
This is not a virus, but you probably shouldn't believe a random file on the internet telling you that either...
